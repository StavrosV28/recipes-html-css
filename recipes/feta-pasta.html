    <p>Feta pasta is a simple, creamy pasta dish made by roasting a 
        block of feta cheese with cherry tomatoes, garlic, 
        and olive oil until the tomatoes burst and the 
        feta melts. The roasted ingredients are then mashed 
        and mixed with cooked pasta, often including additions 
        like fresh basil, creating a flavorful and tangy sauce 
        that coats the pasta.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>Feta cheese</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Pasta(preferably a rotini or cellentani)</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Basil (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Get started by preheating your oven to 400Â°. 
            While it's heating up, mince your garlic and 
            anything else you wish to add to the dish. After 
            preparations have been made, place a block of feta cheese in 
            the middle of the baking dish. Then place all your cherry tomatoes 
            in the dish spreading them around evenly. </li>
        <li>Season all the ingredients in the dish with a little bit of salt, 
            pepper, oregano, and crushed red pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the oven is preheated, place the baking dish inside 
            and bake until the feta is golden. Typically this may take 
            anywhere between 30-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the feta is golden brown, take it out of the oven 
            and put your ready made pasta in the baking dish. 
            Now mix everything together coating all the pasta with 
            the feta/tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with basil and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
