    <p>Feta pasta is a simple, creamy pasta dish made by roasting a 
        block of feta cheese with cherry tomatoes, garlic, 
        and olive oil until the tomatoes burst and the 
        feta melts. The roasted ingredients are then mashed 
        and mixed with cooked pasta, often including additions 
        like fresh basil, creating a flavorful and tangy sauce 
        that coats the pasta.</p>
