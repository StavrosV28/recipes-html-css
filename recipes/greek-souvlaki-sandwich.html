    <p>The beauty of souvlaki, Greece's most popular street food, 
        is its simplicity. Its name is a diminutive of the Greek 
        word souvla, which means skewer. Essentially, 
        it's meat on a skewer, grilled over charcoal and served 
        in various ways, most commonly wrapped in pita bread along 
        with sliced tomatoes, potatoes, onions and tzatziki.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butterflied boneless pork loin chops</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Pita Bread</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Tzatziki</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix fresh herb sprigs, onion & garlic slices, 
            olive oil, vinegar, and a pinch or two of salt and
            pepper. Place meat in a large pan and add the marinade. 
            I like to massage the meat a little with the marinade mixture. 
            Cover with a towel and let it marinate from <strong>30 minutes to an hour</strong>.</li>
        <li>Heat a grill pan or cast iron pan. Add a tablespoon of 
            olive oil. When oil is very hot grill a few pieces at a 
            time for <strong>1-2 minutes tops.</strong> </li>
        <li>Cut up the tomatoes in slim wedges, thinly slice up 
            half an onion. Sprinkle a little dry oregano. 
            Season with a pinch of sea salt, some pepper, a 
            teaspoon of olive oil, and a dash of white wine vinegar. 
            Mix together and let it sit for <strong>30 minutes</strong>. </li>
        <li><strong>Making tzatziki is super easy</strong>. You mix Greek yogurt, grated cucumber, minced garlic, some dill, a splash of white wine vinegar and you are done.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assembling our Pita</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a pita on a piece of parchment paper. Right in the center, 
            add some meat pieces. </li>
        <li>Add some tomato-onion mix and a couple of tablespoons of tzatziki sauce. 
            You can also add a couple of French fries if you like.</li>
        <li>Roll up your souvlaki securely with the help of parchment paper. 
            Fold the end bit so your sauces wonâ€™t drip at the end.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
