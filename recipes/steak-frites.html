    <p>Steak frites is a classic bistro dish of steak and French 
        fries, with origins disputed between France and Belgium, 
        and is considered the national dish of Belgium by some. 
        The dish consists of a juicy, properly cooked steak, often 
        pan-seared or grilled, paired with perfectly crisp, 
        buttery French fries.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nice piece of steak (<i>I prefer NY strip</i>)</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making your herb butter by whipping together 
            some softened unsalted butter in a stand mixer with the 
            paddle attachment until it is light and fluffy, which 
            takes about 5-7 minutes. Next, add the rosemary, thyme, 
            green onions, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, 
            and pepper until combined and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the russet potatoes to your desired size and add 
            them to a container with cold water. Once they are done 
            cutting, drain them into a colander and rinse them 
            thoroughly. Add them to a deep fryer or pot of oil at 
            <strong>300° and cook for 3 minutes</strong>. When 
            ready to serve, <strong>turn the heat to 350° and cook for 3 
            more minutes</strong>. Season with salt and serve.</li>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan over high heat with oil until it 
            smokes. Season the steak on all sides with sea salt 
            and pepper, add it to the pan, and turn the heat to 
            medium. Add thyme, garlic, and butter, and <strong>cook for 3 
            minutes per side while basting the steak</strong>. Rest for 3-4 
            minutes before serving (the perfect time to recook the 
            fries at 350° for 3 minutes).</li>
        <li>Serve on a plate and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
